* Laravel 9 installation requires the most up-to-date form of PHP 8. 

* Laravel, as a framework, depends on several community-driven and Symfony 9 libraries. As Symfony planned to release v6.0 by November 2021, that forced the Laravel team
to delay the release of Laravel v9. The PHP 8 requirement is because Laravel 9 is solely dependent on Symfonyâ€™s latest v6.0 release, which depends on PHP 8.
